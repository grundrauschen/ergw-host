# Readme for ergw-host

The purpose of this repository is to provide host images for running errGW-contianers on.

In the current architecture, erGW needs a custom kernel module to function.
To make it easier for you, to try out your architecture, we provide ready made
images to execute the containers including the kernel modules.
